# ltag ESP32 project

Homebrew lasertag project using an esp32 as the core for the laser pistols.

Very early days. I've got some of the foundational hardware pieces to work using the esp32 ( IR Tx/Rx, OLED display, WS2811 LEDS ), but now its time start to form this all into a single unit. This project will be the first attempt.
